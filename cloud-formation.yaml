# Usage:
#   aws cloudformation --region us-east-2 create-stack --stack-name RESTSQLDemo --template-body file://cloud-formation.yaml

# This template will:
#   Create a VPC with:
#       1 Public Subnets
#       1 Private Subnets
#   An Internet Gateway (with routes to it for Public Subnets)
#   A NAT Gateway for outbound access (with routes from Private Subnets set to use it)
#     

# Connect to the EC2 instance through SSH
# After creating the instance, we want to connect to it through ssh to install the webserver. 
# This requires a key pair to be created in AWS, and the output pem file to be used when connecting. 
# Do this by navigating to the AWS console → EC2 → Key Pair. Create a key pair, and give it a name. 
# Once completed, a .pem file with the same name will be generated (the one I generated is called restsql-demo.pem)
# For more info on how to generate a key pair have a look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#prepare-key-pair
#
# After the stack is up, grab its public IP address and use it together with your SSH certificate to connect:
#
# ssh ubuntu@<copied IP address> -i ~/restsql-demo.pem
